# Agent Factory — State

*Milestone: v0.1.0 — Factory MVP*

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** A working factory cluster that generates self-contained AI agent cluster artifacts
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Runtime (Database + State Machine)

## Session Log

### 2026-03-02 — Plan 01-04 executed (DatabaseManager + aiosqlite WAL)
- Stopped at: Completed 01-04-PLAN.md
- Last commit: 9b101b0 feat(01-04): update test_database.py from xfail stubs to GREEN tests
- Key decisions: WAL mode assertion uses tmp_path (not :memory:) — WAL silently falls back to "memory" mode on in-memory DBs; DatabaseManager is connection factory only, no DML; pragmas via individual execute() not executescript to avoid implicit COMMIT

### 2026-03-02 — Plan 01-03 executed (TaskStateMachine + TDD)
- Stopped at: Completed 01-03-PLAN.md
- Last commit: 1bbd4df feat(01-03): implement TaskStateMachine with InvalidTransitionError
- Key decisions: TRANSITIONS.get(current, set()) defensive pattern; TaskStatus re-exported from state_machine; 100% coverage achieved (14/14 stmts)

### 2026-03-02 — Plan 01-01 executed (package structure + schema + test scaffold)
- Stopped at: Completed 01-01-PLAN.md
- Last commit: df02bcd feat(01-01): create test scaffold
- Key decisions: importorskip at module level for test_models.py and test_state_machine.py; xfail for test_database.py; create_goal/create_task as plain async helpers (not fixtures)

### 2026-02-28 — Phase 1 context gathered
- Stopped at: Phase 1 context gathered
- Resume file: .planning/phases/01-core-runtime-database-state-machine/01-CONTEXT.md
- Key decisions: WAL-native connection pool, TaskStateMachine + Pydantic validation, cluster db up/reset runner, in-memory test fixtures

## Current Position

- Phase 1 of 7: Core Runtime (Database + State Machine)
- Current Plan: 04 of 05 complete
- Status: Plan 01-04 complete — DatabaseManager with WAL, per-connection pragmas, init_schema/up/reset, 7 GREEN tests, 88% coverage
- Next: Plan 01-05 (CLI — cluster db up/reset commands)

## Blockers / Concerns

None.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| aiosqlite connection: 1 write + 1 read per agent | WAL-native, stagger handles write serialization | — Done (01-04): open_write/open_read both apply STARTUP_PRAGMAS |
| TaskStateMachine class + Pydantic enum validation | Defense in depth, typed exceptions | — Done (01-03): TRANSITIONS dict + InvalidTransitionError with from_state/to_state attrs |
| rejected = action not state | Cleaner state machine, rejection recorded in task_comment | — Done (TaskStatus has 5 values, no "rejected") |
| Python runner over schema.sql, no Alembic | SQLite doesn't need migration versioning in v0.1 | — Done (01-04): up()/reset() async methods call init_schema() |
| 100% coverage for state machine, 80% for DB layer | Pure logic fully testable, DB layer has I/O edges | — Done (01-03): state_machine.py at 100% (14/14 stmts) |
| TRANSITIONS.get(current, set()) defensive pattern | Unknown current states raise InvalidTransitionError not KeyError | — Done (01-03) |
| TaskStatus re-exported from runtime.state_machine | Single import line for callers instead of two | — Done (01-03) |
| schema.sql is source of truth; DatabaseManager uses Path(__file__).parent / 'schema.sql' | Keeps DDL co-located with code; factory copies to cluster output in Phase 5 | — Done (01-01) |
| importorskip at module level for test_models.py and test_state_machine.py | Cleaner than per-test skip; entire module skips when implementation absent | — Done (01-01) |
| create_goal/create_task as plain async helpers (not fixtures) | Callers pass open db connection explicitly — test bodies stay readable | — Done (01-01) |
